My assignment

Part A

c. Follows accessibility guidelines where appropriate.  
Headings are used correctly to organise content  
Includes proper alt text for images  
Colour is used with care  
Form is designed for accessibility (labels, tabbing, grouping)   
Tables used for tabular data, not for layout  
Content can be accessed with the keyboard alone in a logical way  
ARIA roles and landmarks used to identify navigation menu, header and main content  

d) <center><img src ="pictures/privacystatement.jpg" width=800></center>


e) Identify and discuss: 
•	The types of security issues that website designers should consider. Include this discussion in your README file.  
Some of issues worth considering are cross-site request forgery, security misconfiguration, insecure direct references and broken authentication and session management. 

1)	Cross site request is when an attack is launched into deceiving a user into taking an action which they did not mean to perform. Hacker’s target users by sending a request to an application where a user is already authenticated against. In sites of commercial dealings, this can provide the hacker with access to sensitive personal information. 

2)	Security misconfiguration is centred around the maintenance or lack of it in an application. An insecure configuration gives hackers access to private data and can result in the compromise of an application and its aim to keep data safe and confidential.

3)	Insecure direct object reference are files, databases, directories that expose a reference to an internal implementation object. Exposure of these allow a hacker to manipulate these references increasing their chances of accessing a user’s private data. 

4)	If authentication identifiers are not safeguarded, an attack can seize the identity of the user and use it for their own purposes. This is caused by broken authentication where user credentials are robbed before, during or after an online session time. 

These are just some of the many points web developers should take seriously. 

•	How HTTP caching and Content Delivery Networks could further improve responsiveness. Include your discussion in your README file.

Benefits of caching

The benefits of http caching are that they can contribute to the sites performance on the internet. It can achieve this through reducing the latency attached to accessing online documents. As the cache is closer to the user this should greatly reduce latency and raise the performance of web browsing.

Caching can also increase performance by decreasing the effort required by the remote web server. This is accomplished by data being spread evenly over a network. 

Caching can also provide robustness during times when a server might be down. Access to a cached copy at the proxy ensures that the web service is resilient during where remote servers are not operational or performing at a less than desirable standard.   

A major advantage of caching is that considerably decreases bandwith consumption significantly reducing network traffic congestion. This is important for users wanting video streaming, to play games or just to do online shopping. Increased performance contributes to an enhanced user experience. 


Benefits of CDN

The ideal of a strong CDN is to serve users with high availability and performance content online. The speed and delivery of a content is important to every user. 

CDN will decrease the load on your server enabling it to handle an increase of users. This is accomplished by spreading the content across several servers. 

CDN’s also seek to make the delivery of content faster. A cached site by a browser means that accessing material will be fast as the site does not have to be downloaded again. This also takes a lot of pressure of the networks and their loads.

Latency and packet loss are also improved through the CDN which improves the delivery of packets of information to the user. This greatly improves the definition of the content received contributing to increased user satisfaction. 

There are also invaluable storage and security advantages provided by CDNs. CDNs provide secure storage for content which is essential to meeting the needs of their users. CDNs can protect content and restrict access to it through user authentication.
